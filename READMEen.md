## About the experiment
This is not about bringing forward a shiny new product but rather learn how to make something. Therefore I have the pleasure of presenting several versions of this bug.

### Polling
https://github.com/LA9IHA/piBug/blob/main/pb_polling.py

This version is based on a recurrent check of the paddles.
